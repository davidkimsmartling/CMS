    <string name="faq">FAQs</string>
    <string name="faq_title">Frequently Asked Questions</string>
    <string name="help_center">Help Center</string>

    <string name="faq01_title">What is Life360? </string>
    <string name="faq01_data">Life360 is a free smartphone app that helps keep families and close friends stay in sync throughout their busy day. With Life360, you can see where your family and friends are on a private map, stay in touch with group and one-on-one messaging, and get help in an emergency. Life360 was started in 2008 and has 70 million members and growing!</string>
    <string name="faq02_title">Is Life360 free?</string>
    <string name="faq02_data">Yes! Our core service is (and always will be) 100%% free of charge.  However, we do offer some premium features for a small monthly fee.  Life360 Premium is $%1$.2f/month and gives you more of the app you love. Plus, you can try it for free for 30 days!</string>
    <string name="faq03_title">What phones will run Life360?</string>
    <string name="faq03_data">We work on iPhone, Android, and Windows devices or over SMS using a non-smartphone. We were previously able to offer a beta app in Blackberry, but this app has been discontinued.\n\nYou can also use our app on iPods, iPads and some other tablet devices, but your location will only update when you are connected to the internet.\n\nTo locate someone who owns a non-smartphone, you will need to upgrade to Life360 Premium, which is $%1$.2f per month.</string>
    <string name="faq04_title">What is 24/7 Live Advisor?</string>
    <string name="faq04_data">With the push of a button, the app will instantly connect you to a real person who can:\n\n· See your current location\n· Give you personalized crisis care\n· Access your emergency profile\n\nCan you limit the number of emergencies in your life? Of course not. That’s why you will have unlimited use of the service and there is not a limit to the number of calls you can make.</string>
    <string name="faq05_title">A Circle Member stopped updating. How do I fix this?</string>
    <string name="faq05_data">First, make sure they have the newest version of the app and are logged in — you’d be surprised how often this is what is wrong!  If you still are having issues, take a look at our troubleshooting guide.</string>
    <string name="faq06_title">Can I lock the app on a Circle Member’s phone?</string>
    <string name="faq06_data">No.  Anyone in your Circle can uninstall the app at any time.  We don’t see ourselves as a “tracking” company, and believe our app is at its best when we are used as a communication and safety tool, not as a big brother.</string>
    <string name="faq07_title">What is the Crime Alert feature?</string>
    <string name="faq07_data">The purple pins you see on your map are areas where a crime was reported.  This feature is available inside the Life360 app in the US and parts of the UK, but some cities will not have crime stats available.\n\nTo select how often you want the crime data to update, follow the steps below.\n\nOpen Menu\nTap on Settings\nTap on Map Options\nTap Crime\nChoose Time Frame (The feature will default to Auto-Select which means we will show you the most recent crime in the area you are searching)</string>
    <string name="faq08_title">How do I turn the Crime Alert pins off?</string>
    <string name="faq08_data">To hide the purple Crime Alert pins, follow these steps in the app:\n\nOpen Menu\nTap on Settings\nTap on Map Options\nTap Crime\nSelect OFF</string>
    <string name="faq09_title">Can someone locate me without me knowing it?</string>
    <string name="faq09_data">No, for someone to find your location using Life360, you will need to give us your explicit permission by installing our app and logging into your account or if you have a non-smartphone, replying YES to the text message invitation which asks you to join a Circle.  As soon as you logout of Life360, no one will be able to locate you.  Similarly, if you reply NO to the text message invitation on your non-smartphone, you cannot be located.</string>
    <string name="faq10_title">How do I improve an inaccurate location?</string>
    <string name="faq10_data">The first thing you should do is make sure your Circle member has all location services turned ON on their phone, including GPS and WiFi.\n\nPlease note that accuracy depends on many factors, such as your environment and your phone.  At times, a highly accurate location won’t be available.</string>
    <string name="faq11_title">Does the app drain my battery?</string>
    <string name="faq11_data">Life360 has the lowest battery drain of all locator apps on the market.  We have an advanced algorithm that helps us decide when to wake up your phone and update your location—so we never just leave your GPS on.\n\nBut, every app that uses location will use some extra battery.  Most users should expect about 10% shorter battery life when running Life360.</string>
    <string name="faq12_title">Is my information secure?</string>
    <string name="faq12_data">Yes, we use bank level SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption and other military grade security protocols. We are independently verified by VeriSign.</string>
    <string name="faq13_title">How do I cancel my free account?</string>
